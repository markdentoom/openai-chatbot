For the upcoming technical interview, we'd like you to create a basic prototype using the LangChain (JS) library. This prototype should be able to answer a potential customer's question that might be asked through Live Chat or email.

You don't need to set up a NodeJs backend or create a fully automated system. It's sufficient if the prototype can return an answer using console.log when you run the command node index.js.

-	Utilize the LangChain (JavaScript library) for this task.
-	Set up a vector store using OpenAI embedding.
-	Use OpenAI as the Language Model to provide answers to these customer
questions: 
    -	"I can't log in. What should I do?"
    -	"How do I update my address?"
    -	"How do I delete my account?"
-	Please refer to the attached CSV file to source the answers to these questions.
-	Please use a vector storage for your solution. 

The goal is to have a basic working example ready so that you can explore more possibilities during the interview. You will discuss this test case, but [interviewer] will also have 2/3 minor challenges prepared for you (it is not necessary to submit the completed task before the interview).
